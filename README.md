This program only creates the resource pack 'structure'
and the rest of the resource pack you need to complete, including what 
additional folders you need to make, files etc.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

After you finish your resource pack, you can select all the elements in the same 
directory/path/location as the 'pack.png' file or the 'pack.mcmeta' file and zip them.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARCHIVE/ZIP THEM CORRECTLY IN .ZIP FORMAT!

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Do not delete the 'resources' folder or the program will not work correctly.
You can find this program old version in the 'oldversion' folder
